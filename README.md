C - Simple Shell Project
--------------------

Welcome to the Simple Shell Project by Zuriel Victus Azameti and Chigozirim Uwaezuoke! This project is a simple implementation of a Unix shell using the C programming language. This shell can be used to run commands, execute scripts, and manage processes.

Getting Started
To use the Simple Shell, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

**Copy code**

_$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/simple_shell.git_
  
Once you have cloned the repository, you can compile the shell by running the following command:

**Copy code**
  
_$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh_
  
This will create an executable file called hsh. To run the shell, simply type $ ./hsh in your terminal.

**Usage**
  
The Simple Shell supports many of the same commands and features as a regular Unix shell. Here are some of the most commonly used commands:

$ ls: list the contents of the current directory
  
$ _cd: change the current directory
  
$ pwd: print the current working directory
  
$ echo: print a message to the console
  
$ exit_shell: exit the shell
  
In addition to these basic commands, the Simple Shell also supports I/O redirection, background processes, and pipeline commands.

**Contributing**
  
If you would like to contribute to the Simple Shell Project, please fork this repository and submit a pull request. We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug fixes to new features.

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure to run the test suite by typing $ make test in your terminal. This will ensure that your changes do not break any existing functionality.

**Credits**
  
The Simple Shell Project was created by Zuriel Victus Azameti and Chigozirim Uwaezuoke. Special thanks to our contributors for helping to improve the shell and add new features.
